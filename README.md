# VolcanoActivityMonitor
Fullstack project for an assignment.

# Frontend
Using Angular for the GUI.
Using Leaflet as the library for the Volcano map.
Using observables for dynamic content.

Using Java SpringBoot for the backend.
Decided to use the java.net.http.HttpRequest libarary instead of RestTemplate because of MimeType issue.
Using regex for parsing for simplicity
Made the PostgresManager a singleton because I want only one instance of the connection to the database
Using liquibase to create the initial tables in the DB.
# Devops
Using PostgreSQL as the Database.
