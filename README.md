# VolcanoActivityMonitor
Fullstack project for an assignment.

# Frontend
Using Angular for the GUI.
Using Leaflet as the library for the Volcano map.
Using ComponentFactoryResolver and Injector to inject component into leaflet popup.

Using Java SpringBoot for the backend.
Decided to use the java.net.http.HttpRequest libarary instead of RestTemplate because of MimeType issue.
Using regex for parsing for simplicity
